# Advent of Code 2022
## Description
Most likely rather inefficient solutions for the 2022 Advent of Code puzzles.

## How to use
Run the Main.java class and it will ask you for an input.<br/>
Type the day that you want to see the solutions for (it will show both parts for that day).<br/>
Input should be an integer and will only be accepted if I have implemented the solution for that day.<br/>
